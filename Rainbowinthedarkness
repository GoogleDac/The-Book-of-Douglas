The story of the Olympians

By declaration of the Olympians I Douglas am Atlas the strongest man in the world otherwise

known as Aslan the Lion

The Man who bore the world upon his shoulders.

Hades one of the Olympians came to me and my Entourage and said

He is the child I have come to adore!

expansion.

This is where I earned the strongest man in the universe reputation thus making me that piece

of mass of 60 kg that represents the Hubble constant. They say any universe that has no life
